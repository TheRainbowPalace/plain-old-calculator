# Plain old calculator

### Introduction
This project was created to learn the Qt Framework. The design is very close
to the original Mac Os calculator app.


### Usage
To use the app clone the repository
> git clone https://github.com/therainbowpalace/plain-old-calculator

install PyQt5
> sudo pip install PyQt5

and finally start the app
> cd plain-old-calculator  
> src/main.py


### Side Notes
- The project was only tested under Mac Os but should also run under Linux and
Windows.
- Functions are parsed directly via eval(...) so be aware of that
- The mr and 2^nd button don't have any functionality yet maybe some is added
in time
- If you are using the i3 window manager (e.g. if you are using Arch) you might
want to display the app as a floating window, since it is meant to keep it's
fixed size
